# Enhanced Stock Price Prediction using Ito's Lemma and Machine Learning

A sophisticated hybrid model that combines **stochastic calculus** (Ito's Lemma), **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**, and **deep learning** to predict stock prices with enhanced accuracy. This project leverages LSTM networks with attention mechanisms to learn market dynamics and improve traditional financial modeling approaches.

## üöÄ Features

- **Hybrid LSTM-GBM Architecture**: Combines deep learning with stochastic differential equations
- **Enhanced Technical Analysis**: 20+ technical indicators including RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- **Multi-head Attention Mechanism**: Captures complex temporal dependencies in market data
- **Stochastic Parameter Prediction**: ML-powered drift and volatility estimation
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Advanced plotting for model performance and market analysis
- **Risk Analysis**: Monte Carlo simulations with confidence intervals
- **Real-time Predictions**: 6-month forecasting with uncertainty quantification

## üìä Model Architecture

The `EnhancedStockPredictor` class implements a sophisticated neural network that predicts three key parameters:

- **Price Prediction**: Direct stock price forecasting
- **Volatility Estimation**: Dynamic volatility modeling using sigmoid activation
- **Drift Calculation**: Market trend estimation with tanh activation

### Key Components

1. **LSTM Layers**: Capture sequential patterns in financial time series
2. **Multi-head Attention**: Focus on relevant historical periods
3. **Feature Extraction**: Dense layers for complex pattern recognition
4. **Parameter Prediction**: Separate heads for price, volatility, and drift

## üìà Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from stock_predictor import train_enhanced_model, enhanced_analysis_and_visualization
```

Train the model for a specific ticker

```python
ticker = "AAPL" # or any stock symbol
model, scaler_X, scaler_y, enhanced_data, feature_columns, metrics = train_enhanced_model(
ticker,
sequence_length=60,
epochs=100
)
```

Generate predictions and visualizations

```python
results = enhanced_analysis_and_visualization(
ticker, model, scaler_X, scaler_y,
enhanced_data, feature_columns,
forecast_months=6
)
```


### Advanced Configuration

Customize model parameters

```python
model = EnhancedStockPredictor(
input_size=22, # Number of features
hidden_size=128, # LSTM hidden units
num_layers=2, # LSTM layers
dropout=0.2 # Dropout rate
)
```

Adjust training parameters

```python
train_enhanced_model(
ticker="TSLA",
sequence_length=90, # Longer sequences for more context
epochs=200 # More training epochs
)
```


## üî¨ Technical Indicators

- MACD and MACD Signal
- Price change and log returns

### Volatility Measures

- Volume lag features

## üìä Model Output

The system provides comprehensive analysis including:

### Visualizations
1. **Training Performance**: Loss curves and prediction accuracy
2. **Price Forecasting**: ML vs Traditional GBM comparison
3. **Risk Analysis**: Probability distributions and percentile analysis
4. **Technical Analysis**: Price charts with indicators
5. **Volatility Analysis**: Historical vs predicted volatility

### Metrics
- **Expected Returns**: ML-enhanced vs traditional estimates
- **Volatility Predictions**: Dynamic volatility modeling
- **Profit Probability**: Statistical likelihood of positive returns
- **Risk Percentiles**: 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th percentile analysis

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

The model is based on the **Geometric Brownian Motion** equation derived from Ito's Lemma:

dS = ŒºS dt + œÉS dW

Where:
- `S`: Stock price
- `Œº`: Drift parameter (predicted by ML)
- `œÉ`: Volatility parameter (predicted by ML)
- `dW`: Wiener process (random walk)

The ML model learns to predict `Œº` and `œÉ` dynamically based on market conditions, improving upon static parameter assumptions in traditional models.
